    <h2>What is the Y2038 bug?</h2>
    <p>
      The Y2038 bug is a computer bug that is related to the way that computers store and handle
      dates. It is also known as the "Year 2038 problem", the "Unix Millennium bug", or the
      "Epochalypse".
    </p>

    <h3>How does a computer store a date?</h3>
    <p>
      To store a date, computers use a numerical value to represent the year, month, day, hours,
      minutes and seconds. This numerical value is often based on the number of seconds that have
      passed since a specific point in time, known as the "epoch". Different operating systems use
      different epochs, but a common one is January 1, 1970 at 00:00:00 UTC.<br />This means that,
      most of the time, computers represent a date as the
      <b>number of seconds that have passed since January 1, 1970 at 00:00:00 UTC</b>.
    </p>

    <br />

    <div class="storing-example">
      <p>Here is the current date:</p>
      <date-clock></date-clock>

      <br /><br />

      <p>
        Number of seconds since January 1, 1970 at 00:00:00 UTC (also called <b>Unix Timestamp</b>):
      </p>
      <number-clock base="10" size="10"></number-clock>

      <br /><br />

      <p>
        A computer stores numbers in a <b>binary</b> form, which is a system of representing numbers
        using only <b>two digits: 0 and 1</b>. These digits are known as <b>"bits"</b>.
      </p>

      <p>Here is the representation of the Unix timestamp in binary:</p>
      <number-clock base="2" size="31"></number-clock>

      <p><b>As of today, it takes 31 bits to store the current date in a computer.</b></p>
    </div>

    <br />

    <h3>Why size matters</h3>
    <p>
      To those 31 bits, a computer often also <b>prefix them with a bit to define the sign</b> of
      the number (<kbd>0</kbd> for positive, <kbd>1</kbd> for negative). This allows computer to
      store the current date into <b>32 bits, or 4 bytes</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In practice, this means that the maximum date that can be stored in a computer is
      <b>January 19, 2038 at 03:14:07 UTC</b>. After that, the value will "overflow":
    </p>

    <div class="overflowing">
      <number-clock base="2" size="4"></number-clock>
      <span class="equal"></span>
      <number-clock base="10" size="2" modulo="16"></number-clock>
    </div>

    <p>
      In the above example, we use 4 bits to store a number. The maximum value that can be stored in
      4 bits is <kbd>15</kbd>, which is represented by the binary value <kbd>1111</kbd>. If we
      increment it again, it will overflow and restart at <kbd>0</kbd>, which is represented by the
      binary value <kbd>0000</kbd>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since most computer use the first of the 32 bits to define the sign of the number, when the
      value will overflow, it will become negative. This means that the second after January 19,
      2038 at 03:14:07 UTC will be <b>December 13, 1901 at 8:45:53 PM UTC</b>.
    </p>

    <p><b>Since computers don't handle well time-traveling, this is a problem.</b></p>

    <br />

    <h2>Is it already happening?</h2>
    <p>
      <b>In some cases, yes.</b> If a software uses 32 bits to store a date, it may not be able to
      handle dates beyond the year 2038, even if it is used before that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      A recent example of the 2038 problem documented on
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem#Early_problems">Wikipedia</a>:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>
        In May, 2006, reports surfaced of an early Y2038 problem in the AOLServer software. The
        software would specify that a database request should "never" timeout by specifying a
        timeout date one billion seconds in the future. One billion seconds after 21:27:28 on 12
        May, 2006 is beyond the 2038 cutoff date, so after this date, the timeout calculation
        overflowed and calculated a timeout date that was actually in the past, causing the software
        to crash.
      </i>
    </p>

    <br />

    <h2>What can I do about it?</h2>

    <p>
      <b>There is a solution:</b> Instead of using 32 bits, computers should use 64 bits to store a
      date which will not overflow for 292 billion years.
    </p>

    <h3>As a user</h3>
    <p>
      As a user, you can ensure that your devices and software are
      <b>kept up to date with the latest patches and updates</b>. As soon as softwares are fixed to
      use 64 bits to store dates, you'll be safe from the Y2038 bug.
    </p>

    <h3>As a developer</h3>
    <p>As a developer, there are a few steps you can take to prepare for the Y2038 bug:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify any systems or code that may be affected by the Y2038 bug</li>
      <li>
        Update the way that dates are stored or processed to use a larger numerical value, such as a
        64-bit integer
      </li>
      <li>
        Test systems and code to ensure that they are able to handle dates beyond the year 2038
      </li>
      <li>
        Communicate with other stakeholders, such as users or vendors, to ensure that they are aware
        of the Y2038 bug and any steps that may be necessary to prepare for it
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Variants</h2>

    <h3>Y2106 bug</h3>
    <p>
      The Y2106 bug is a similar problem that is expected to occur in the year 2106, when the
      numerical value used to represent dates will again overflow. The difference being that
      computers use the full 32 bits to represent dates without using the first bit for the sign.
    </p>
    <div class="clock-2106">
      <number-clock base="2" size="32"></number-clock>
    </div>
    <p>
      The Y2106 bug is expected to be less severe than the Y2038 bug, as it is expected that most
      systems will have been updated to use a 64-bit integer to represent dates by that time.
    </p>

    <h3>Y2K bug</h3>
    <p>
      The Y2K bug, or "Millennium bug", was a similar problem that occurred at the turn of the
      millennium, when many systems were not prepared to handle the transition from the year 1999 to
      the year 2000. The Y2K bug was caused by the fact that many systems used a two-digit
      representation of the year, which meant that the year 2000 was represented as "00". This could
      have caused issues when these systems attempted to process dates after the year 2000, as the
      two-digit representation of the year would have been indistinguishable from the year 1900. The
      Y2K bug was largely fixed before it could cause significant issues.
